Magical Arena 

Description:

The Magical Arena game is about battles between two players, each defined by their attributes: health, strength, and attack. Players take turns attacking and defending until one player's health reaches zero. I implemented the game logic in Java.

Setup:

1. Requirements:
	 Eclipse IDE
	 Java Development Kit(JDK)
2. Project Setup:
	Open Eclipse IDE.
	Create a new Java project with name MagicalArena.
	Create Java classes (MagicalArena, Main, PlayerTest) into the project's source folder (src).

Usage:

1. To the run the game:
 	open the 'Main.java' file , right-click within the 'main method'.
	select "Run As" > "Java Application".
	The game will start running in the console, displaying the progress of the battle between the two players and atlast dislays the winner of the game.

Testing:

Unit Tests:

	The project includes unit tests for the Player and MagicalArena classes.
	To run the unit tests:
		Open the PlayerTest.java and MagicalArenaTest.java files.
		Right-click within the test methods.
		Select "Run As" > "JUnit Test".
		Review the test results in the JUnit view to ensure that all testcases are passed.
